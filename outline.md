### Python Teaching Outline

#### **Module 1: Introduction to Data Types in Python**

**Objective**: Understand the basic data types in Python and their usage.

**Topics**:
1. **Overview of Data Types**
   - Primitive vs. Non-Primitive Data Types
2. **Integers (`int`)**
   - Definition and usage
   - Basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
3. **Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)**
   - Definition and usage
   - Basic operations
4. **Boolean (`bool`)**
   - Definition and usage
   - Logical operations (and, or, not)
5. **Tuples (`tuple`)**
   - Definition and immutability
   - Accessing elements, slicing, nesting
6. **Dictionaries (`dict`)**
   - Key-value pairs
   - Adding, removing, and accessing elements
7. **Lists (`list`)**
   - Definition and mutability
   - Common operations (append, remove, index, slicing)
8. **Objects (`object`)**
   - Introduction to objects and classes
   - Creating and using simple classes and objects

**Activities**:
- Hands-on exercises for each data type
- Small projects like creating a contact book using dictionaries


#### **Module 2: Syntax of Python**

**Objective**: Learn the basic syntax and structure of Python programs.

**Topics**:
1. **Introduction to Python Syntax**
   - Case sensitivity
   - Indentation
2. **Variables and Assignments**
   - Variable naming rules
   - Assigning values to variables
3. **Basic Input and Output**
   - `print()` function
   - `input()` function
4. **Operators**
   - Arithmetic operators
   - Comparison operators
   - Logical operators
   - Assignment operators
5. **Control Flow Statements**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
   - Looping statements (`for`, `while`)
   - `break` and `continue` statements
6. **Comments**
   - Single-line and multi-line comments

**Activities**:
- Writing simple programs using loops and conditionals

#### **Module 3: Functions in Python**

**Objective**: Understand how to define and use functions in Python.

**Topics**:
1. **Introduction to Functions**
   - Definition and purpose of functions
2. **Defining Functions**
   - `def` keyword
   - Function naming conventions
3. **Function Arguments**
   - Positional arguments
   - Keyword arguments
   - Default values
   - Variable-length arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`)
4. **Return Statement**
   - Returning values from functions
5. **Scope and Lifetime of Variables**
   - Local and global variables
6. **Lambda Functions**
   - Definition and usage
   - Comparison with regular functions

**Activities**:
- Creating and calling functions with different types of arguments
- Exercises to practice using return statements and scope
- Implementing simple lambda functions

#### **Module 4: Advanced Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming**

**Objective**: Dive deeper into advanced data structures and introduce object-oriented programming concepts.

**Topics**:
1. **Advanced List Operations**
   - List comprehensions
   - Nested lists
   - Common list methods (`sort`, `reverse`, etc.)
2. **Advanced Dictionary Operations**
   - Dictionary comprehensions
   - Nested dictionaries
   - Common dictionary methods (`get`, `items`, `keys`, etc.)
3. **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and objects
   - Attributes and methods
   - Constructor method (`__init__`)
   - Inheritance and polymorphism
4. **Working with Objects**
   - Creating and using objects
   - Understanding `self` parameter
   - Encapsulation and abstraction

**Activities**:
- Hands-on projects involving nested data structures
- Simple class creation and object manipulation
- Exercises on OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism
